    description:
      eze: "The Think Eze is the ideal boat for a lot of people. It’s fast, fun, and sporty, with the soul of a racer, yet it’s 5.2m length make it maneuverable, stable, and forgiving. The Eze’s hull shape creates a strong platform for new paddlers to develop their technique with confidence. The ergonomics are excellent, and seat comfort outstanding. Experienced paddlers will love the quickness and maneuverability of the Eze, and be blown away by how easy and fun it is to surf. A boat that puts a smile on every face!"
      ace: "At Think Kayak we always get to work on fun stuff, but this time we’ve super-sized it with the Ace. If three words could sum up this new craft it’s stable, fast, and fun! At 56cm wide the Ace is our most stable ski, but her sleek &ldquo;swede&rdquo; form means the Ace has the speed of a performance ski. The 5.38m length is highly maneuverable, great for exploring along the coast line, or linking waves when you find the wind at your back. The gunwale is low beside the seat, making remounts a snap should the need arise, and the integrated carry handle makes off the water handling a breeze. For big fun on the water, the Ace is for you!"
      evo-ii: "The Think Evo II offers ultimate balance of speed and comfort. At 6.25m in length, with fine entry and exit lines, and 47cm of width, the Evo II has all the speed you need to be in the thick of the competition. Glide is excellent, and when the swell is up, linking runs has rarely been so much fun! We believe the most important aspect of any boat is to allow paddlers to paddle their best. In other words, to be the best engine they can be. That means providing a level of stability that creates a platform for power, even when the going gets rough! In this regard the Evo II stands clearly apart from its competitors, offering an unsurpassed level of stability for a boat this quick. The Evo II has an amazingly comfortable seat and foot well for all day comfort during long training sessions or races. The foot board system has a micro adjust system, so getting the perfect fit is easy. Every detail is well thought out, with a separate reinforced leash attachment point when heading out on big days. Hardware is 304 grade stainless for long term durability, and our rudder lines use 600 pound test Q-PowerLine Spectra."
      ion: "Get your positive charge on with the new Think Ion! At 6.42m x 44.5cm she clearly belongs in the advanced boat camp, but the Ion puts a new spin on things. Chief in the design criteria were speed, stability, and big water performance, all perfectly integrated in this podium worthy craft. The Ion’s high-rocker design pays back with a remarkably smooth upwind ride and razor sharp downwind performance. That little bit of extra width gives the Ion ample secondary stability, critical when you need to apply full power for full speed ahead! The width also allows just enough room to fit the very comfortable, and ergonomically correct Evo II bucket, essential in getting the most out of you!  If you’re looking for a race-winning ski, and love those windy days best, the Ion is made of the right stuff for you!"
      uno-max: "The Uno Max, winner of the Euro Challenge, Byron Bay Ocean Paddle, the Dubai Shamaal, the Mayor’s Cup, Cape Point Challenge, the US Surfski Champs, the Australian Ocean Racing Series, and the 2013 ICF World Championships. Simply put, there is no boat more capable of winning a race on any given day no matter what conditions are presented.  The Uno Max is the worlds fastest surfski! The Uno Max features all of the Think standards. Dedicated leash attachment point, pluggable footwell bailer, Q-Powerline Spectra rudder line, 304 stainless hardware, security handles, and 10cm inspection port. Rudder options include 12.5cm flatwater, 19cm weedless, 23cm surf (standard), and 25.5cm surf extreme."
